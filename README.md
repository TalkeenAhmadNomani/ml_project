# Student Marks Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based Student Marks Prediction System** that uses multiple models internally to predict student marks based on different parameters. The model with the **best accuracy** is selected dynamically for prediction. 

## Feature
- Utilizes **multiple ML models** to ensure the best prediction accuracy.
- Selects the **best-performing model** dynamically.
- Provides an intuitive **Flask-based UI** for easy input and result visualization.
- Takes multiple parameters as input for accurate prediction.

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Decision Trees, Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS.
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Flask.
